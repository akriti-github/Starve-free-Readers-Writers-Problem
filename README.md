# Starve-Free-Reader-Writer-Problem

The Reader-Writer Problem is designed such that while multiple readers can read the shared resource simultaneously, only one writer will be allowed to modify the shared resource at any given time. The two most common approaches to solve this problem using synchromization are:

1) Writers Starve (Readers are given priority)
2) Readers Starve (Writers are given priority)
